[Issue](https://codesandbox.io/s/cool-hermann-hncn2)

Unable to use State properly in the comp when I use HOC on it.


b) [useState](https://codesandbox.io/s/broken-platform-087s7)

We see that setState() can be made synchronous using async and await. But I am unable to achieve it in useState. The useState() also performs updates asynchronously like setState. Can I achieve the same thing in useState???
